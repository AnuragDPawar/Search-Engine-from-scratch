# Search-Engine-from-scratch
The project consists of five phases of building a basic search engine from scratch.

## Phase 1 : Tokenization
1. Parsing the HTML document using BeautifulSoap (Version: 4.9.2)
2. Cleaning the parsed string using RegEx
3. Tokenizing the words from the cleaned document using NLTK 3.7
